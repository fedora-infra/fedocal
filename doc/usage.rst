Usage
=====

Users
-----

Fedocal has basically two levels for the users:

 - administrators
 - users


Administrators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Administrators are people with an account on the
`Fedora account system (FAS) <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/>`_ and
belong the administrator group as set in the :doc:`configuration`.

Administrators are the only people allowed to create a calendar and edit all
the meetings.


Users
~~~~~

Users are people with an account on the
`Fedora account system (FAS) <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/>`_ and
belong to at least one more group than the ``fedora_cla`` group which
every contributor should sign to contribute to Fedora.



.. _create_calendar:

Create calendar
---------------

After logging in, if you are in the administrator group, you will see an
``Admin`` entry in the left menu containing a link to ``Create calendar``.
Use this link to create a calendar.

The form to will ask for:

- ``calendar name``: the name of the calendar as used in the link and as title
  for this calendar.

- ``calendar contact``: an address email that will be publish as contact point
  for this calendar. This is not linked to :ref:`reminders` but it is more
  aimed at providing an email to people wanted to obtain information about a
  specific calendar.

- ``calendar description``: a short description of what the calendar is used for.
  This description will also show up on the page of the calendar and should
  thus not be too long.

- ``calendar managers group``: the name of the
  `FAS <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/>`_
  group to which people should belong that will manage the calendar
  (ie: create meetings).

- ``multiple meetings``: by default a calendar does not allow someone to create
  a meeting or an event on a specific date if there is already something
  planned at that time that day. By turning on this option, the calendar will
  become less strict and allow multiple meetings at the same time on the same
  day. This option should remain off for calendars handling for example IRC
  meetings.  It should be turned on for calendar handling for example
  Ambassadors events where mutiple events can occur on the same day at
  different locations in the world.

- ``region meetings``: by default, you can not associate a meeting with a region,
  by turning on this option you can. This allows to "tag" a meeting or an event
  as concerning a specfic region and thus allows someone to check out only
  the meeting within his region.

  Regions are meant to be 'NA', 'APAC', 'EMEA', 'LATAM'.

  Note that this can also be used to filter meetings retrieved via the API.


.. note:: To create a new calendar in the `Fedora instance of fedocal
          <https://apps.fedoraproject.org/calendar>`_ you will need to
          create a ticket on the `infrastructure trac
          <https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/>`_


Edit a calendar
---------------

One can edit a calendar if she/he is an administrator as defined
above.

To edit a calendar, select the calendar to edit in the main menu by
clicking on its name. Then go to the ``Admin`` entry of the main menu and
select ``Edit calendar``.

When editing a calendar you will have the same field as when creating one
(see :ref:`create_calendar`).



Delete a calendar
-----------------

One can always delete a calendar if she/he is an administrator as defined
above.

To delete a calendar, select the calendar to delete in the main menu by
clicking on its name. Then go to the ``Admin`` entry of the main menu and
select ``Delete calendar``.

You will see a confirmation page where you will have to select the checkbox
to confirm the deletion of the Calendar.

.. note:: Deletion of calendar is a permanent operation which will also
   destroy all meetings of the calendar. You will thus loose all the
   history of the calendar without possibility to undo it.

A general iCal feed is available for all the calendar at once at::

 http://<url to fedocal>/ical/



List view
---------

Sometime it is interesting to have an overview of all the meetings over
a given time period. The easiest way to achieve this is simply to have a
list of all the meetings in this period.

This list view can be found at::

 http://<url to fedocal>/list/<calendar name>/

This page can also be accessed from the main menu, for each calendar
under the `List view` link.

By default this will show you the list of all the meetings in the current
year, but you can restrict or change the period by specifying a year or
a year and a month or even a year, a month and a day::

 http://<url to fedocal>/list/<calendar name>/<year>/
 http://<url to fedocal>/list/<calendar name>/<year>/<month>/
 http://<url to fedocal>/list/<calendar name>/<year>/<month>/<day>/

          person that created the meeting is registered to the list in order
          for the reminder to be allowed.
