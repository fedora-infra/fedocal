-----------------
Source:  https://pagure.io/fedocal.git/
Mirror on github: https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedocal
(Please use Pagure as the main repository and make sure
you run your patch against it)

Documentation: http://fedocal.rtfd.org


Dependencies:
-------------
.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/
.. _SQLAlchemy: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/
.. _alembic: https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/alembic
.. _iCal: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar
.. _python-vobject: http://vobject.skyhouseconsulting.com/
.. _pytz: http://pytz.sourceforge.net/
.. _dateutil: http://labix.org/python-dateutil

This project is a `Flask`_ application. The calendars and meetings are
stored into a relational database using `SQLAlchemy`_ as Object Relational
Mapper (ORM) and `alembic`_ to handle database scheme changes.
fedocal provides an `iCal`_ feed for each calendar and relies on
`python-vobject`_ for this. Finally, `pytz`_ is used to handle the timezone
changes and `dateutil`_ to allow date manipulation over months/years.

The full list of dependencies can be found ine the ``requirements.txt`` file.


Running a development instance:
-------------------------------

Clone the source::

 git clone https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedocal.git


Copy the configuration files::

 cp fedocal.cfg.sample fedocal.cfg
 cp alembic.ini.sample alembic.ini

Adjust the configuration file (secret key, database URL, admin group...)


Create the database scheme::

 FEDOCAL_CONFIG=fedocal.cfg sh createdb


Register the application to iddev for development::

  oidc-register https://iddev.fedorainfracloud.org/ http://localhost:5000/oidc_callback


Add the following two lines in your configuration file `fedocal.cfg`::

  OIDC_ID_TOKEN_COOKIE_SECURE = False
  OIDC_REQUIRE_VERIFIED_EMAIL = False


Run the server::

 python runserver.py --config fedocal.cfg

You should be able to access the server at http://localhost:5000 (do not use
``127.0.0.1`` as it will no work)


/!\ If login in does not work and gives you an ``invalid return_uri`` check
  the ``redirect_uris`` in the ``client_secrets.json`` file and make sure it
  matches **exactly** (check http vs https, trailing slash vs no trailing slash...).
  You may have to re-register as editing directly the ``client_secrets.json``
  file will not work.


Git Branches:
-------------

This project has three principal git branches:

* ``master``: this is the default branch in which development is done. It is the
  branch from which releases are made. It is the branch feature branches are
  branched from and get merged into.
* ``staging``: fedocal is deployed in the Fedora infrastructure in openshift
  using s2i, the staging environment is built from this branch. This branch has
  one extra commit that is not in ``master`` which adds all the files and changes
  necessary to deploy fedocal in openshift using s2i. This branch is therefore
  rebased and force-pushed when the staging fedocal instance is updated.
  Pull-Request should not target this branch.
* ``production``: this branch is used for the same situation as the ``staging``
  branch but for the production fedocal instance. It also contains an additional
  commit that is not in the ``master`` branch and is therefore force-pushed
  after a rebase when the production fedocal instance is updated.
  Pull-Request should not target this branch.


Testing:
--------

This project contains unit-tests allowing you to check if your server
has all the dependencies correctly set.

To run them simply call::

 tox

.. note:: To stop the test at the first error or failure you can try:

   ::

    tox -- -x

.. note:: To run a single file you can try:

   ::

    tox -- tests/test_flask.py -x
