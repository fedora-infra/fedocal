Fedocal
=======

Fedocal is a web based calendar application for Fedora.


A number of groups in Fedora are using a calendar to coordinate their work,
and at the moment the only tool at their disposition is the
`wiki <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki>`_ with all the challenge of properly
formatting tables in the mediawiki syntax.


This project aims at providing a single place where these different calendars
can be found and managed. This should save us from wiki page such as
the `fedora-meeting irc calendar
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Meeting_channel>`_ or the `ambassador event
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Events>`_ page
which are either hardly maintained or plain un-readable.


Additionally, a number of groups are sending reminders for their meeting, this
is true for the regional ambassadors, the board, and the infrastructure
meetings.  This application aims at automating this process in order to take
this task off the shoulders of fellow contributors.
